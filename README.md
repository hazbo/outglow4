###Disclaimer
This project is NOT currently stable. Check it out if you like, but if you're looking
for a good stable framework, I'd highly recommend NOT using this one, YET. Thanks!

#Setup
##Tests
So far, this has been tested with the following setups:

  - Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (precise)
	- Apache2 (with or without .HTACCESS)
	- Nginx (current version)
	- PHP 5.3*
	- MySQL (optional)
	- MongoDB (optional)

So as far as I can tell, so far it seems like it will be fairly flexible. I have
not tested this on any Windows servers.
